Blender based Parametric Hull Generator

bpyhullgen was started for the purpose of generating parametric boat hulls.

bpyhullgen uses python and [Blender 2.8](https://www.blender.org/) to generate the mesh geometry.

One of the design goals of the project is to generate hulls with curves and surfaces that result in easily developable faces that can be cut from plate surfaces such as plywood, steel plate or aluminum plate and will bend and assemble together with minimal distortion and manipulation. 

It has been tested on Linux. I have not tried it on other platforms yet.

Example bulkheads with minimum floor height defined to allow for a level floor surface between bulkheads.

Example hull shape with longitudal stringers added and notched automatically with bulkheds for easy integration.
