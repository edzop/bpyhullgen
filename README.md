bpyhullgen is a Blender based Parametric Hull Generator

**bpyhullgen has been updated for blender 2.92**

The WIKI has been updated to reflect new projects generated with bpyhullgen.

bpyhullgen was started for the purpose of generating parametric boat hull designs that can easily converted to real world objects. 

One of the design goals of the project is to generate hulls with curves and surfaces that result in easily developable faces that can be cut from plate surfaces such as plywood, steel plate or aluminum plate and will bend and assemble together with minimal distortion and manipulation.
