Blender UV Map -> export UV Map as (Svg)
import into inkscape (small boxes) - not working

import SVG into blender (works as lines)

convert curve to mesh (assign material)
delete vertices inside object (maintain perimeter only)

join individual islands to single mesh object
remove doubles
select all
select boundry loop
select inverse
delete edges (selected)

export as DXF

# Method I use to call blender for debugging so I can see code window simultaneously

blender -p 10 200 1900 1200 -P tests/filename

===================================

extrude lines (normal orientation)

add circle - bool subtract rathole

perpendicular cuts instead of angle 

==========================================
Auto separate plates
==========================================
if input curve length all same length - bool output mesh all aligned vertices - all nicely arranged
if curves different length - oddly matching vertices because of scaling
plates - after import UV unwrapped

    - selection into segments
    - separate by selection
    - add shape for cutout
    - apply bool to both sides of plate (union / difference)
